Part - 2: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y7UoHD_lSTrIXDF3iy3j09a7YhH6lcwd?usp=sharing

I have also attached the Jupiter Notebook files for both the parts with the submission.

For any reasons you cannot use the Google Collaboratory or Jupiter Notebook there is need to run the .py files, make sure you have installed the following libraries on your system:

1) Numpy (https://numpy.org/install/)
2) Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
3) Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
4) Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)

In the .py files, I have commented out the lines which plot the graphs to avoid problems if you are using just a CLI for operations. You can uncomment them to see the plots if needed.
